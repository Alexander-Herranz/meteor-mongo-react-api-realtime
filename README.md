# meteor-mongo-react-api-realtime
React JS Views with mongo+node API in meteor environment.
Realtime API (DDP) to add programming languages (only if logged in, register functionality included).
Any one (no logged in) can add frameworks to each language.
There is a track of which user added each language.
Everything with a minimalistic material design style (materialize css).

Try to update anything in a device while you see the webapp in another device, and you will see the change automatically 
without any browser refresh (websockets magic)!1
